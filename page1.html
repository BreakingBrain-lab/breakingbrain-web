           <p class="blocktext"><strong>Hello, my Friends</strong> <br>
            I admit it. I've become addicted to learning.<br>
            Remember age is only a state of mind.<br>
            You're as young as you think.<br>
            First of all, you need to believe in yourself.<br>
            Secondly ask yourself: What for?<br>
            To be honest I've become learned English after 40.<br>
            Earlier it's only an illusion.<br>
            To be honest I've become learned to code after 40.<br>
            Honestly, I didn't believe in myself back then either.<br>
            I've created my website.<br>
            This website I made with my hands and brain.<br>
            Find your people. Find your support group.<br>
            But right now... I believe in you.<br>
            I believe in you and what you could become.<br>

            Best regards,<br>
            Barbara<br>
